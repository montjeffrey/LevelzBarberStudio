# üéØ Get REAL Instagram Photos - Step by Step Guide

## üìã **Method 1: Manual Instagram URLs (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step 1: Get Your Instagram Post URLs**
1. Go to **https://instagram.com/levelzbarberstudio**
2. **Click on each photo** you want in your gallery
3. **Copy the URL** from your browser (looks like: `https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123/`)
4. **Repeat for 12 photos** (or however many you want)

### **Step 2: Update Your Config**
1. Open `components/gallery/config.js`
2. Find the `manual` section
3. Replace the example URLs with your real ones:

```javascript
manual: {
    enabled: true, // ‚úÖ Keep this true
    posts: [
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/YOUR_REAL_POST_1/',
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/YOUR_REAL_POST_2/',
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/YOUR_REAL_POST_3/',
        // ... add up to 12 real Instagram URLs
    ]
},
```

### **Step 3: Test**

## üöÄ **Method 2: Advanced Automatic Scraper**

This method tries to automatically get photos but may not always work due to Instagram's protections.

### **To Test:**
1. Set `scraper.enabled: true` in config.js

3. Refresh your gallery
4. Check browser console for results
